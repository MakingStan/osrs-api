# **Osrs api**
A tool made in java to easily access the osrs api's

JDK 17, 

for example:

    ```Api.Hiscores.getAttackLevel("Stan xD", false, false, false)```
Will return my attack level. which is 97.

We can also do this with the GE

    ```Api.Ge.getItemName(577)```
And this will return "Earth Rune".
You can use any function desired.


**note**::
Calling a hiscores function like getAttackLevel can work on an ironman even without specifying that it is an 
ironman with saying it's true that it's an ironman. 
The only difference will just be the rank.
